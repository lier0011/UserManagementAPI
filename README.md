# UserManagementAPI
This is a simple .NET-based user management API as part of my coursera assignment 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-development-with-dotnet/

I did the base implementation by myself and then using Copilot to do the following improvements:
* Middleware for Logging, Exception and Token-Auth
* Controller for all the CRUD endpoints
* Model for User incl. Validation

I provided a file called requests.http which contains some endpoint requests needed for the API test.
